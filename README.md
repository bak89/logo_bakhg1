# Project Logo 2020 


### Prerequisites

For this project you need to install : 
- Apache Ant
```
https://ant.apache.org/.
```
- JavaCC ver 6.1.2
```
https://javacc.github.io/javac/
```


### How it works: 

Modify the build.properties file with what you want to parse, just the filename (e.g.: "filename=demo")

From command line launch:
```
ant clean
ant parser
ant compile
ant run
```
